# Open Source Abstract Strategy Games #
### Status ###
Abandoned work in progress.
Currently usuable (demo instance can be found [here](https://djmclaugh.com/osasg)), but there are no plans to continue developement.


### What is this? ###
A website with many ~~abstract stratagy~~ turn based games available.

### Core Principles ###
* I want this website to be open source and genuinly free (no ads or promotion).
* I want people to be able to easily start a game without having to make an account.
* I want a clean and easy to use interface that works nicely on as many devices as possible.
* I want to be able to save replays and have a built in game tree viewer/editor.
* I want to implement ratings and allow users to create tournaments.
* I want people to be able to write AIs for particular games and submit them for other players to play against and rate them against other user submitted AIs.
